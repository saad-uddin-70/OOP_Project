# Land & Area Management Note

General Muhammad Ataul Ghani Osmani maintained a private note containing the names of districts he had successfully made independent, along with their respective land areas. This information was organized within a page titled "Division." Furthermore, the division names were recorded in a separate note titled "Bangladesh." 

It was established that any updates made to the land area of a district within the private note would automatically affect the total area of the corresponding division. Consequently, these changes in the division's area would subsequently be reflected in the "Bangladesh" note, thereby updating the overall land area of the country. This ensured that any modifications made at the district level would have a cascading effect on the division and national levels, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information regarding the land areas of districts, divisions, and Bangladesh as a whole.
## Features
- **Add Divisions:** Easily add divisions along with their respective land areas to the land management system.
- **Add Districts:** Add districts with their areas and assign them to the corresponding divisions for efficient organization.
- **Modify Districts:** Update the area of a district within its division, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Calculate Total Land Area:** Calculate the total land area of Bangladesh by summing up the land areas of all districts within each division.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects:** The code utilizes classes to define the structure and behavior of entities related to land, divisions, and districts. Objects are created from these classes to represent specific instances.

- **Inheritance:** The code demonstrates inheritance by utilizing the concept of base and derived classes. The derived classes, such as `Division` and `District`, inherit properties and behaviors from the base class `Land`.

- **Encapsulation:** The code exemplifies encapsulation by encapsulating data and behavior within the classes. Data members are declared as protected or private, and member functions provide controlled access to these data members.

- **Constructor:** The code includes constructors in the classes, which are special member functions used to initialize objects when they are created. Constructors define the initial state of objects.

- **Member Functions:** The code contains member functions within the classes to define the behavior of objects and enable interaction with their data.

- **Operator Overloading:** The code showcases operator overloading, allowing the customization of operators for the classes. The `<<` operator is overloaded for the `Division` and `District` classes to provide customized output.

- **Friend Functions:** The code demonstrates friend functions, which are functions declared as friends of a class and have access to its private and protected members. Friend functions, such as the overloaded stream insertion operators, can interact with the classes.

- **File Input/Output (I/O):** The code utilizes file I/O to read from and write to files. It includes operations such as creating and updating text files to store division and district information.
